# Go Fiber API Clean Architecture Template (with PostgreSQL)

A production-ready starter template for building scalable RESTful APIs in Go using the Fiber web framework and Clean Architecture principles—designed for speed, maintainability, and real-world use.

This template cleanly separates concerns across delivery, usecase, repository, and domain layers, making your codebase modular, testable, and easy to evolve.
🔧 PostgreSQL integration is baked in with a repository layer that supports clean DB interactions.

Includes:
🧩 Modular Clean Architecture structure
⚡️ Fiber for fast and minimal API routing
🛡 Middleware-ready (CORS, Logging, Recovery, etc.)
🔐 Environment-based config and secrets management
🗃 PostgreSQL support via pgx or gorm
✅ Easy to extend with unit/integration testing

Ideal for developers who want to skip boilerplate and build real-world Go APIs fast—with architecture that scales.
